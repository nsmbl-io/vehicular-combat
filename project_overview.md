Twisted Metal-Inspired Multiplayer Game – Development Overview

Overview

This project is a real-time vehicular combat game inspired by Twisted Metal, built with Three.js for rendering, WebSockets for multiplayer, and hosted on Render. The gameplay will feature a free-for-all combat arena where players control vehicles, pick up weapons, and battle both other players and AI-controlled bosses.
 
Core Features

1. Game Map: Washington, D.C. (From Twisted Metal III)
• The map will be based on the Washington, D.C. level from Twisted Metal III.
• It should include recognizable landmarks such as the White House, the Washington Monument, and other key areas to create an immersive battle arena.
• The map should be large but not overly complex, ensuring fast-paced action while keeping loading times minimal.
• Destructible elements (e.g., certain buildings, objects) are encouraged to add dynamic gameplay.
 
2. Game Flow & UI

Vehicle Selection Screen
• When users navigate to the website, they will immediately see:
• The vehicle selection screen in the foreground.
• Live gameplay happening in the background (spectator view of the current battle).
• Players will choose a vehicle before joining the match.
• Once selected, the player will spawn into the battle immediately.

Boss System & Global Health Bar
• The game features AI-controlled bosses that spawn periodically.
• The boss’s health bar will be displayed globally at the top of all players’ screens.
• Boss difficulty scales dynamically based on the number of players in the game at the time of boss spawn.
• The difficulty levels are:
• Easy 1-5 players
• Medium 6-10 players
• Hard 11-15 players
• Insane 16-20 players
• Twisted 21+ players

4. Boss Vehicles (AI-Only)

The game will feature 3 boss vehicles that spawn periodically. Their difficulty scales based on the number of players at the time of spawn.
Boss	Playstyle	Special Attacks
Sweet Tooth (Ice Cream Truck)	Medium Speed, High Armor	Flaming Clown Head – Fires a homing fireball that explodes on impact.
Darkside (Armored Semi Truck)	High Armor, Slow	Shadow Slam – Charges forward and slams into enemies, causing knockback.
Minion (Demon Tank)	Very High Armor, Slow	Missile Storm – Fires a barrage of homing missiles.

5. Weapons & Pickups

The game will feature only the most popular and easy-to-use weapons from the Twisted Metal series.

Weapon	Type	Effect
Fire Missile	Standard Missile	Fast, moderate damage, slight homing.
Homing Missile	Tracking	Weak damage, strong homing.
Power Missile	Heavy	Slow, very high damage, no homing.
Special Attack	Vehicle Specific	Instantly regenerates user’s special attack.
Turbo Boost	Turbo	Recharges user’s turbo boost.
Partial Health	Heal	Restores some vehicle HP.
Full Health	Heal	Restores all vehicle HP.

• Weapon pickups will spawn at key points in the map.
• Players cannot hold infinite weapons – each pickup gives a set number of uses.
• Health pickups will be rare, forcing players to fight smart.
6. Multiplayer & Networking
• The game will use WebSockets for real-time multiplayer.
• All players are in the same match (no separate lobbies).
• Players will auto-respawn after death (no waiting).
• Boss fights are cooperative (all players temporarily team up to take down the boss).
• Weapon and health pickups will be synchronized globally.
 
7. Hosting & Performance Optimization
• Hosted on Render for both frontend (Three.js) and backend (WebSockets server).
• Low-poly models and stylized graphics to ensure fast loading and no lag.
• No loading screens – instant access to gameplay.
• Vehicles and explosions will be kept lightweight for smooth performance.
• Minimal UI clutter – the focus is on fast-paced action.
 
8. Controls
- Keyboard only for all controls. Choose a layout that is intuitive and makes sense.
 
Next Steps
• Cursor should begin by creating the vehicle selection screen with live gameplay running in the background.
• Implement basic vehicle movement and WebSocket-based multiplayer synchronization.
• Add basic combat mechanics (shooting, taking damage, respawning).
• Implement boss spawn logic with scalable difficulty.
• Add pickup spawns for weapons and health.
• Optimize graphics and game performance for web-based play.
